 - move explicit code gen flags to ABI "pre digester" function
 - pass constant data through to PE/ELF as asm items
   - possibly design load-time constant rules for language? meh
 - pass a crate pointer into the runtime
 - start crate structure real stupid: refcount + 1 function table
 - have the runtime allocate a *kernel* function table 
 - have the runtime call back into crate fn 0, passing kernel function table
