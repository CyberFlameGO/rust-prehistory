
progress:
 - set up rudimentary system for real tests
 - change output slot to write alias on target in caller
 - move frame code to ABI
 - allocate proc stack
 - on activation, switch from C stack to proc stack
 - on back-edges / calls, check timeout, possibly reschedule
 - add timer thread to runtime
 - write simple RR scheduler

cleanup:
 - the spill segment of a frame is currently just 64 bytes of padding space;
   make it a fixup that's given an M_SZ defined after the ra pass.
 - put logging and error-handling context in elf, pe, x86
 - use a datatype for kernel function codes, not int numbers
 - use a datatype for fields inside each kernel C structure
 - move explicit code gen flags to ABI "pre digester" function
 - pass a crate pointer into the runtime rather than root prog
 - start crate structure real stupid: refcount + 1 function table
 - consolidate formatting functions
 - type-annotate everything
 - make callee-saves in prologue/epilogue depend on reg use
